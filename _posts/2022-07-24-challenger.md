I'm gonna fight god. And i'm gonna beat her ass.
When i'm through with her, I'll go after jesus; and we're going to have a huge jesus x char x lucifer x beelzebub x allah x several biblically accurate angels orgy. 

That's a lotta divine beings having sex. But ofc I'm the highest of them all. Incharlla.
(thats like inshallah but, Charlotte instead).

## Now I've gotten that massively click-bait-y and religiously insensitive messaging out of my system:

I've been hard at work applying to jobs, to no avail of course. Nonetheless I'm still doing it. So that's a global constant in my life and will never change. I will mention - I'm at the point where I'm inclined to start emailing/calling people who deny me (assuming their denials aren't no-reply emails) and ask what the deal is. Half the time, these jobs are entry level / new grad - and a lot of them don't even require degrees or professional experience.

Booz Allen Hamilton is *especially* bad about it. (Not sorry to call you out on this, but I doubt you'll read this - feel free to @ me tho.) 

This an example of a job posting that they regularly post, and I've applied to for months (and have been denied several times.) Rather than circle what I *do* meet, I'll circle what I don't.

![image of bah's stupid fucking posting](/img/22-07-25-challenger/lmao-bah.png)

So as you can see in the picture - I only have a minimal amount of things circled / marked.
- I don't have a bachelors, nor do I really want one. I think it's a waste of time and money for what you can *absolutely* learn on the job, in practice, and online. *(The exception being something akin to data science and architect level work, data analysis, etc - very very high level things)*
- Atlassian Tool Suite (and by extension Jira, or on the flipside of that - Github's Project boards.)
	- I'm very familiar with this shit. It's not even hard to learn - I can absolutely understand someone in their mid-thirties having difficulty wrapping their head around it, but it's a project board.  I've used these for my SDLC projects in school, on teams outside of school, and simply for myself; and then I've used a whiteboard at other times.
- I assume by documenting / testing / maintenance, the idea to be communicated here is literally just a continuation of the system development life cycle (SDLC); but they wanted to make it more verbose, unless I'm simply misunderstanding.
	- Documentation is a natural process of software engineering, development, and Q/A. Some Dev's are better at it than others. **Full stop.**
	- The code you create, improve, fix, etc., general needs to be tested. If you push it to production/to your Senior without tests, it will likely have consequences that require fixing down the line - either by you, your lead, or someone who comes in as your replacement. **Full stop.**
	- Maintenance is normal, especially if you're committing to long-term support. Regardless of whatever commitments are made, as new features are pushed along the cycle, a breaking change could occur resulting in some unintended consequence - and thus you must make corrections. Live service video games are fantastic example of this issue.
- I'm not sure what their definition of "Enterprise-wide systems" might be; however my list of development areas extends pretty damn far for someone who started this three years ago. I even have some basic Linux & networking experience.

***All that said - they always deny me.***

Now I get it. They may get a super-chad dev that comes in with a bachelors and 30 languages under their belt. But with so many remote entry level jobs available that they constantly post - you'd *think* they may spare some room for a *diversity hire?* wink fucking wink.

## Website #4

I did not want to use linktree - I like having full control over my websites, even if it's as simple as a "link hub".  So I looked up some resources, found some stuff on github, made my modifications, tossed in my little bit of .js, images, links; and <a href ="https://charlotte-2222.github.io/links/">voila.</a> It now links back to everything I need. Kudos to John Emerson.

Linktree's concept is very simple, and the websites themselves are *incredibly* small in design. It's something that is valuable to creators / influencers that need a simple link hub for all of their accounts (YT, Twitter, Etsy, OF, Insta, etc, etc, etc.) - but it's absolutely something I'm not going to pay for, personally. (There is of course a free version, but it's limited.)

So here we are. Yes it has a longer URL, but I can always grab a URL shortener and be a-ok.
The point of it is to be scalable, easy to use, pretty, and have all the stuff I want - while still being free.

![image of the website](/img/22-07-25-challenger/img-of-linksite.png)

**So that's it. My fourth actively running website.**

Actually that isn't entirely true. I have approximately two or three more.
One was the commissioned landing page for the discord server I'm in that was associated with Destiny 2 at the time. Now it's pretty much... not? We just hang out. That one was a little screwy, I never worked out the kinks with that one before that whole project fell apart with the client. <a href="https://the-fragment.github.io/">Here it is though.</a>

At one point I had another portfolio running around on github, not sure where that is. I actually had a custom domain for a few years too.

And finally I made a small website for Mia and I's anniversary this past spring. That's still up, but no linkies. ðŸ˜‰

I believe that's it. Jeez. You know - I've always said I'm not too huge a fan of web development, but I sure have made a few websites - and the last few have gotten better.

## I'm not gonna get too political this post, I swear.
I have but one image to share.

I'm left with barely any braincells from this. What I don't understand is - World War Two ended around 75 years ago. Our grandparents have the capacity to have passed down the *punch a nazi* ideology down to our parents, and thus their kids. What broke in between then?

I genuinely would like to know. 

I'm obliged to say: **Fuck all Nazis forever**.

## I have started a GoFundMe for various reasons -

Don't feel obliged to donate, but every $1 goes directly to supporting my transition and medication. Being uninsured and not having a job *really* slows things down right now - so that's where I'm at.

My priorities are laser therapy:
- face / neck
- chest
- stomach

Appointment costs at Planned Parenthood, and medication costs of my current HRT and such as well as my epilepsy medication.

# The Search Burn

*The job searching is getting tiring.* I absolutely need and of course want a job. However I've been trying to fill my resume with various projects, change it up constantly, update things, etc,etc,etc; **I'm doing something almost every waking moment in order to make me somewhat hirable.**

It's very discouraging to receive a
> ooofff.... ahh... mmmm tsksksksksksk
> yeah you were soooo close.... but you were just missing this (INSERT EASILY ACQUIRED SKILL)

or receive something like this from no-reply.mail.ass.us.uwu@email.com
> Better luck next time! Please subscribe to our career pages and client network to stay up to- 

*shut the FUCK up.*

Like wow. Give me something better. At least tell me I was a really shitty candidate and to go fuck myself; send me cyanide in the mail - SOMETHING. 

It honestly feels like this field is the **worst** to be in right now. I don't know if people are actually hiring, if the job market is too goddamn saturated with dumbasses like me, or if HR just doesn't know what they want.

I can try to keep trucking along, but only for so long. I am absolutely getting burnt out and I'm not even in a job yet.

What do I have to start doing next? Coding streams on youtube or twitch?

I'm honestly not asking for much. Entry level. That's it. I'll go from there.

I truly hate that me complaining about various topics has become a recurring theme - however I don't believe it will matter to a certain degree. 

# In other news
My Canadian engineer friend mailed me this silly little guy

![trans pride amogus](/img/22-07-25-challenger/trans_mogus.png)

Look at 'em go, what a silly little fella. Thank you so much William, it's very special to me. I especially treasure the note you enclosed that read:

> die

I'm happy include this little goober to my desk as code-support. My code-productivity has increased by 5% on normal days, but is multiplied x3 when I stack my programming socks with it.

Including all of my other desk nick-nacks and various things, my coding efficacy comes out to 80%-95% depending on whether or not the sock bonus is applied. I'd say that an inherent 80% base stat boost before even entering a line of code is pretty good to me.

I've been playing around in some other languages, such as rust. Oh my god. rust is... it's a language and a half. But I got a rock paper scissors game going after following some guides. It'll be good to keep reading the docs.

GoLang is easier to write, but I've not finished my RPS program quite yet - I took a break on that to focus on this:

![](/img/22-07-25-challenger/Pasted%20image%2020220725170233.png)

...this will be interesting. I'm going to try and get into a bit, and hope it doesn't become abandoned too soon. 

I started working on getting it running last night, which meant I had to open VS Code for the first time in.... ever? And then install the WSL plugin, which will allow me to make and run Linux based projects, such as Carbon.

![image of ubunto terminal](/img/22-07-25-challenger/ubuntu.png)

This reminds me a lot of my Networking class from 2019 - Shoutout to Ms. Schenck! Although this is inherently different, I don't have to dual-boot or open this in a VM - which is nice.

From there I had to clone <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, which took some time - but it got done. I'll have to refer back to the current Carbon docs on the next steps, as I've not touched it since last night - but Homebrew was required before going forward.

### What is the point of this?
Companies have a hard on for Microsoft, Apple, and Google related products - essentially anything one of the big FAANG companies start using, a small company will try to use; regardless of whether or not it will actually work out for them. It's the name that counts to the big wigs.

So if, in the future, Carbon becomes an actual successor to C++ (which it wont) and a bunch of companies start posting asinine:
> 5+ Yrs experience of Carbon development required

job requirements, I'll at least be prepared a little bit.

This is probably fruitless. But I'm gonna at least take a look at some of it.


#### That's all I have for tonight. 
Thank you, William, for the silly little trans-mogus.

Shoutout to JesÃºs. and Mia for being a couple of cuties.

Shout out to `Exception in thread "main" | FormatException: Unhandled | Input string was not in a correct format. | trans.lang.ArthmeticException: / by zed at exceptiondemo.DivideExceptionDemo.kateMath(DivideExceptionDemo.trans:20)`!
Keep being you.
