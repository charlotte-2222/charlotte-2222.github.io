Today I've been working on this little Discord bot here:

The purpose is to be a RSS feed puller - using Node and Discord.js it will grab my blog's latest updates and repost them to a channel.
<br>
Unfortunately, it's giving me a few problems - such as *not actually posting the feed!*

```js
async function checkRssFeeds(){
    const lastCheck = await getLastCheckTimestamp();

    for (const channel in config.channels){
        await parseChannel(channel, lastCheck);
    }

    await setLastCheckTimestamp();
}
```

But it does run, so we've gotten somewhere - the issue just lies with the rest of the code, and I'm thinking it's somewhere in the above snippet.


So we're going to keep at it.

I am sad.
