In <a href="https://charlotte-2222.github.io/2022/06/25/JS-rss-Bot.html>yesterday's</a> post I mentioned making an RSS feed bot in Node.js.
While the bot is able to run, I'm not experienced with Discord.js' library and have had issues posting / parsing the xml.

### However - Python suites my needs almost perfectly.

<hr>

## Next order of business:
- [X] Read through feed parser docs (again)
- [X] Fix RSS post dumping HTML (it's ugly)
- [ ] Make it loop/stay alive (check for feed every so often)

Thats all for now, I will update this post when there is more progress
