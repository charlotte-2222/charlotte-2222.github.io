I'm not sure what it is that causes me to have such vivid dreams, I suspect it's all of the medications I'm on. I don't dream often, fortunately. At least I don't remember them often if I do, and they don't cause me panic as often. 

But at 4:00 this morning I was hyperventilating in my sleep and experiencing one of the saddest and simultaneously scariest dreams I've had in a *very* long time. So please join me for a bit while we dive into the innermost fucked up thoughts of Charlotte!

## As always, music!

*Romance* is a rather short song, but it's a nice and simple one with some great guitar and bass lines.


# On to the dream

I won't lie. The start of it was incredibly pleasant. To preface, all day yesterday I'd been thinking about filming a "Coming out Video" - just to have on hand for the future. I was thinking about what I might say, what would be addressed, and how I'd move forward. 

So it's truly no surprise that when I slept and began dreaming, it started with something centered around that. My mother was 100% accepting of me and my relationships. So much so that Jesús and I were going to the lake with her for a day. She was happy, we were happy. Jokes were made about Jesús' driving, and about how I'd need to stop at target to get a bikini. It was *nice to be me in a dream.*

But then it weird shifted, and suddenly at that. I found myself in a poorly lit Victorian mansion, wearing a ball gown. I was walking up a spiral stair case as other women who were similarly dressed openly mocked me for how I wore it. I eventually lashed out, only to find that they were ghosts. 

When I finally reached the top of the stair case, I was met by a child - and possibly the most disturbing image I've ever dreamt in my life. He was a pale child with soulless black eyes that bled darkness as well. His teeth were jagged and gray. 

Then he reached out to me, but not with two arms - but four. He had arms that extended from his neck as well as his torso. Over and over, I ran - but he grabbed me and stared at me intensely, and then his mouth moved as if to say something, but I never heard anything.

And I woke up. Mia woke me up, and I cried.

#### Describing this *thing* is hard.

So I used Dalle-2 to render a near perfect representation. I'm actually terrified with how closely it resembles what I saw.

I suppose the only difference would be a longer neck, with arms that could extend out of it - as well as the bleeding eyes.

# Now that I've sufficiently traumatized myself

I'm not quite sure what I'll be doing today. That left me exhausted. 

Mia just informed me that they made friends with a fellow poly/pan person at school, and one of her girlfriends is *also* trans. The prospect of that is really exciting to me, sometimes I feel out of place here - so potential friends are such a huge thing for me right now.

I'm 25 and literally all I do right now is look at twitter, apply to jobs (then get denied), write this blog, and occasionally code. *(I'm purposefully going to leave out the time I spend playing games or watching anime with Jesús and Mia).* Meeting another transgirl in the city would be really nice too. Knowing all this makes me feel a little less alone, that's for sure.

I'm going to leave this off as a very short post. Last post was extra long, so this feels justified. I simply do not have the current mental capacity to keep writing. Happy Monday, you silly fuckers
