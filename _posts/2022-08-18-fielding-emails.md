Things have certainly changed in various ways these past few months. Up until January, my life was very monotonous - always doing the same thing in one way or another. Now, I can be myself, I have a boyfriend, I have a dog, and I'm not often having a day that mirrors another. There's plenty of things I still want, but I'm happier than I was a year ago.

# The job search
It seems like it's looking up, somewhat. I've applied to hundreds places and received just as many denials - even yesterday I had a phone call that felt like a complete waste of time, as 30 minutes later I received an email stating I'd been denied.

However today, I've received numerous emails asking for interviews, even one from MUSC which I'd quite honestly thought had denied me / moved on with another applicant.

I'm now speaking with two recruiters, as well as have two interviews for the coming week.

##### Hopefully these go better than the everything with Bungie Studios and CofC.


# Coding
I've taken a break from any of my projects here lately, I've gotten myself burnt out - and given the fact that I got my financial aid taken away, I'm no longer able to continue in my current program; Thank you very much Epilepsy! Yet again, another thing taken from me. I'm not at a huge loss, I've gained most of what I needed apart from the final group project and another Microsoft Access class - the knowledge is what is what is most important to me.

Had I not needed to take such light semesters so often due to repeated seizures, been hospitalized when I otherwise needed to take a semesters, and generally speaking just been so out of it thanks to meds - I'd be done by now! But unfortunately I'm not, and it doesn't work out that way. But I digress.

The main point is that I've taken a break from my main projects as well as pursuing new projects for the time being due to burnout. After the past 6 years of being in school and doing something or another, and coding nonstop for the past 3; I want a break. I'm not getting paid for it (yet). When I start getting paid, I'll be just as enthused as I was two weeks ago when I started making a programming language.

# Poly days
I get to play Halo with my boyfriend and my partner. This is the type of shit I've always wanted in my life. Up until ~April-ish I did *not* like men. Come July, I have a boyfriend. I dunno what the disconnect was there, but I'm happy. 

The best part is, my partner and I are both nerdy, and our boyfriend is really creative. The dynamic is just a lot of fun. He and I grew up playing the same games; Halo, Ace Combat, Star Wars, etc. My partner didn't play the same games, but they enjoy playing them with us it seems; especially when they can play in the most distracting way possible - cause of course Jesús and I cant have a flawless Halo 2 run, that would be *too easy for Mia*.

# SPEAKING OF!

Jesús just joined the voice chat - meaning it's Halo time! I'm gonna cut this short AF.

kbye
