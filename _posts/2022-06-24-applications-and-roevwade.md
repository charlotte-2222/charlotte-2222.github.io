# Welp, today I finally signed a lease
I've lived with my partner and their roommate for the past 6 (almost 7) months, but haven't 
officially signed the lease - we just never really got around to it.

Clara - their roommate - is moving out the end of July (thank god). That means we get to have
an office!
<br>**The actual signing of the lease sucked though.**<br>
My partner and I don't make enough to have an apartment w/o a guarantor<br>
(^which for some
reason has to be x6 rent? Meaning *one of us needs to make $96k or more...*) - So we had to ask
their dad... which was not-pleasant, at all.

## In other news

Apparently the supreme court is perfectly okay with signing away women's rights,
here is a nice look at the response from all of us:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The scene at the Supreme Court this afternoon <a href="https://t.co/DvUQbCc51s">pic.twitter.com/DvUQbCc51s</a></p>&mdash; Kirsten Appleton (@kirstenappleton) <a href="https://twitter.com/kirstenappleton/status/1540426336925360130?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 24, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

This is a terrible attack on human rights - *women's rights specifically* - a 
bunch of Christian valued geriatrics got up and made this decision, and damn anyone that disagree - ***cause god'll getcha***

And it doesn't stop there.<br>

Justice Thomas already wants to go after Griswold, Lawrence,  and Obergefell</a>
<br>We are actively watching our rights being taken back to the  1920's *in real-time*

I already have to hear about how disgusting I am simply for existing from both my partner's family
and my own, but now I'm going to *actively* lose my rights? Not again.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So, as I understand the Supreme Court, the government can arrest and jail you without Miranda rights, execute you even if your lawyer screws up, force you to have a baby, and use tax dollars to support religion.<br><br>But it can&#39;t protect your right to vote or keep you safe from guns.</p>&mdash; Keith Boykin (@keithboykin) <a href="https://twitter.com/keithboykin/status/1539985166545965056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 23, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

This is where we are in the United States. Thank you, to both sides of the aisle.

## On a more productive note
I went on an application spree (after a huge denial spree, of course)<br>
23 applications - that I kept track of at least. There were a few that did not have any auto-reply (email),
so I'm not entirely sure if that number is accurate.

There were a few interesting positions in there, such as an EA Internship, 
a remote Python dev position from Ireland, generally all of them were interesting.<br>
(Everything interests me though, I need a job)


We'll see what happens! Regardless, I'm committed to programming & committed to keeping this blog active.<br>
That's it for now :)
