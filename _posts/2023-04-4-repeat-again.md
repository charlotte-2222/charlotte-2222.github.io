I've had a weird past couple weeks. I haven't truly known how to feel about it and in many instances - couldn't help but cry as I reacted to what was happening. I've called off a couple possible dates, turned people date, and broken up with people. Simultaneously - I've been ghosted, in fact I've been ghosted multiple times. 

So I think I'll go through some of them, for my own sake. For closure's sake. 

### But a song first

## Late February,

I made a <a href="https://www.charlottes-web.gay/2023/02/24/dates-lesgo.html">post</a> in late February that semi-detailed what was going on at the time. I was talking to two guys, and planned to go on dates with them - originally one that day, and another the following day.

The thing about me is I have issues with any kind of red flag. I find difficulty in choosing the right kind of people, ones who won't hurt me. **This is my first issue, and one of the bigger ones.**

### Date One
The guy I went on a date with that Friday was nice, incredibly nice in fact. Nerdy in a lot of ways - but not in many ways that I might consider myself a nerd. We had different interests, which is good - opposites is never a bad thing. 

The coffee shop he took me to was amazing - and I mean *amazing.* Some of the best coffee I've had locally. I don't consider myself a coffee snob, but given that I only drink black coffee, I will instantly know if the coffee tastes terrible. 

Our conversation was nice. We spoke about what we wanted out of life, what we wanted out of the relationship, what our past histories were like. All kinds of things. At the end, I led him to my car to give him a gift that I'd originally intended for Jory. I hugged him, and kissed him twice. Then I left. 

I later realized he had been lead to believe there would be more of that date - *something more physical.* Of course, leading him to that belief is my fault. I was somewhat teasing him and vaguely mentioned biting him. From there, the relationship went quickly into intimacy - far too quickly for my liking. I hadn't fully developed a sense of emotion for him, and I don't like flings/one night stands - and yet that's simply what it became.

<summary>There's far more to it of course. With me nothing is ever simple. Why would it be? TW: Trauma, SA</summary>
	<br>
	Leading up to and during sex - there were so many times I wanted to say *stop* - and yet again - I didn't. As my hair was being pulled and held in one position, all I could think about was August 2020 when my shift leader at Starbucks suddenly grabbed my head and held it in place.<br><br>
	When he grabbed my chest and hips, when he touched my shoulders or thighs - I didn't feel him. I felt another man. I wanted to cry. I wanted to scream.
	<br><br>
	But all I could do was go along with it.
	<br><br>
	Aftercare was just as bad. I thought I could cuddle with him, I thought I could at least have that time to think of other things and relax, I'd no longer have to panic. Slowly he would reach his hand up to my hair and begin to play with it and scratch it - but then he grabbed a handful and held my head in place - returning that fear tenfold.
</details>

Following that night, I cried multiple times. Often in silence, alone. Trying to hide it. And so I told him I wanted to stop seeing him.

### Date Two
I actually never met this guy, which I feel like is a good thing. It would have ended poorly. Nearly from the start he made vague suggestions I was a merely fetish to him. A kink he wanted to explore. Rather than get to know me as a person, he wanted to have sex. He wanted to talk about shared kinks. He wanted ask personal sex questions. The day before the date, I called it off - I wasn't feeling it. 

I'm a tease. I've done sex-work content. But I don't like being a fetish. I'm a fucking human.

### Since then -

I've talked to a few people, off and on. Most of them did not go well. One of the better dates I've had was with someone named Bryn. We shared a few interests, and they were very pleasant to talk with - as well as quick to set up a date. They wanted to read in the park. This being one of the more interesting dates I've ever been asked on, I happily accepted. 

Despite it being a very cold day, I had thought the date went well, but I suppose not. That said - we talked about a variety of things, giggled at dumb things, made fun of Cole Sprouse. And finally we sat down to read. I had noticed they made little notes and but tabs in their book, and so I asked what the purpose was to which they replied,
> When I come across quotes or sections in my books that I *really* like, something I want to remember or come back and read again later, I'll mark it with tabs and sometimes annotate it!

...which I thought was simply the most adorable thing. At some point, they asked me to watch a movie with them on Thursday of which I happily accepted.

The date ended, I hugged them, sent them a text later that day and told them how awesome the day was & to have a good day at work - *no reply.* Thursday rolls around - *no texts.* 
I had been ghosted.

I contemplate throwing in the towel for dating others when things like this happen.

## Depress & Decompress

I've gotten back into painting, although I've now run out of canvases for the most part - when I can I will fix that issue. Painting is, for me, therapeutic. The act of lighting candles, listening to music, and finally watching as the brush strokes across the canvas with some color.

Thanks to Bryn, oddly enough, I've also started reading more. I'm currently stalling on reading *How High We Go in the Dark* by Sequoia Nagamatsu, as it makes me cry - a lot. Even now I want to read, but I'm thinking back to the previous sections and dread what is to come.

Writing is another thing that is therapeutic, although I tend to do it less often than I feel I should. What I ought to put into text for none to read I instead, selfishly, put on my partners. Venting frustrations about various problems to them is less than ideal for me, but I find myself doing it anyway. I guess I'm selfish like that. I fill my head with noise and make up excuses to tell myself that it's okay, but.

#### As of writing this,
I have not committed any acts of self-harm for one month, eighteen days, twenty hours, and three minutes. The thought lingers there, often. I now resign myself to sleeping through sadness. The painting and reading has helped, however there are days where I don't feel okay, sometimes hopeless. And so I sleep.

It doesn't help of course, not truly. It's a convenient way to forget, momentarily - as with self harm or drinking. Circumstances that offer a momentary lapse where,  *"When does it end? When will enough be enough?"* no longer echoes in your mind.

But when it's over, what do you have? How long does the temporary happiness last? Will it be a week? Two days? An hour? Who can help? Reaching out to others, I often realize we both have our problems. My paranoia makes me question whether it's worth being forward and honest with the intrusive thoughts that creep in my head, the weight on my chest that gets heavier year by year. 

It's easier to hide it away.

## Recent events

Some events are more fruitful than others, and while I'm genuinely excited one over the others, I want to tackle them in chronological order. That makes sense in my head at least.

#### The job hunt is shitty
...as per usual. That said - I've been in a "waiting period" to hear whether or not I've been hired (back) at Guitar Center. I recently applied for a fulltime position in the as an Ops. Associate. 

I worked at GC during 2017-2018 doing guitar sales and am quite confident in saying that it was my favorite job I've had. The work culture was amazing, the coworkers were great for the most part, and my managers / keyholders always had my back with scummy customers.

Going back would be really nice for me, not just for the money - but simply to get out. I mentioned that I worked there previously, gave the location and store owner's name...however forgot to mention that I'm trans and that I did not use that name while working there and Marc, the store owner, doesn't know me by that name. A good friend of mine, Justus, who is a CM there *does* - however I've completely neglected to mention anything to Marc. I think I'll text him briefly and *hopefully* that resolves that.

If I don't get hired for Ops, I'll certainly take guitar sales - I just wanna go back to be perfectly honest. It was a nice job.

### Arson & Kisses
I met an arsonist, and they're the most kind & beautiful person I've ever met. 

Having nearly given up on dating apps, and gotten tired of endless ghosting & vaguely fetishized messages,

> I've never been with a trans before, *I'd like to give it a try*

I was pretty much ready to delete my apps, and be done with it. South Carolina sucks, no one here is a decent person - no one here wants to actually *communicate*, it's shitty. *Or so I thought.*

**Enter Arsonist.**
At first I was unsure of what to expect at first. My first impression was:
- cutie human
- adorable dog
- very cool bike
- Gamer? But what kinda games? 
	- God I hope they're not some kinda platformer nerd

And then we began talking. And they were *truly* on the ball with compliments & pickup lines. But overtime I realized they were genuine, not out of a desire for a "quick fuck and get out". They're seeking a relationship with someone. 

Sunday night we had a two phone calls that lasted for hours. We talked about anything and everything. Our best dates, our worst dates. Our redflags, our greenflags. Our desires & needs, favorite foods. The whole time I'm playing destiny, and they're playing tarkov.
*(They would be playing destiny but they're a silly little enby that got banned for being too good at the game. It's okay, they can play on my computer while I sit in their lap.)*

During this phone call, particularly regarding the conversation of *worst dates* - I realized I said that the date with Jory was my worst one. *A man I was head over heels for - someone I cried about when I realized I was being ghosted, and that I wouldn't have that promised second date.* I said it was the worst. And truly it was. The whole situation surrounding it was. 

I have a terrible habit of becoming highly invested in people, specifically people who show me love & affection. Any form of human kindness will send me over the moon. I've quickly become wrapped around this person's finger, and I don't believe that was their intention. In some sense, it scares me. I'm afraid of messing up. I hate when I hurt my partners in any way. I don't want them to feel like I'm a detriment to them. Even when I say I want to, I don't want to be alone. Perhaps I'm too paranoid.

#### My lovely arsonist...
...they have already filled my heart with so much joy in the short time I've known them. The words they speak, the actions they've taken. The softness of their voice when they speak to me. 

They have so many qualities of my partners Mia & Jesús. I don't particularly believe in fate, nor do I believe in higher powers. With that said - this was unexpected. And for whomever was responsible - I owe you gratitude.

##### As my emotions take hold and I begin to cry over various things,
I'm going to end this with one of my favorite **Bilmuri** songs. They of course make me emotional too, because why the fuck wouldn't they?
