### My lovely arsonist.

I had far more written here on the 4th. Wishful thinking, ranting about past dates, a teenage girl gushing over her new crush. Often times people tend to forget that while I have the body of an adult, my mind sways in emotion - often times I'm nothing more than a hormonal teenager; I am going through puberty version two, after all.

**My dear arsonist,** 
I wonder what it was that made you drop from my life. We shared intimate secrets, shared a mutual hatred for leaving things unsaid. You gave me so much hope. 

You told me I deserved affection, that I deserved care, that I was simply being an anxious girl for no reason when I apologized for being too needy. You told me everything would be okay. You told me that you wanted to provide me with that affection.

And yet a day before you had a chance to deliver and ounce of that affection, you left from my life without so much as a single word. 

My body echoes with sadness sixty-five times over. Sadness, pain, failure to understand. I wish I knew. I wish you would tell me. 

I suppose I mistook you for something you weren't. I wish you had never come into my life into the first place, or perhaps never given me this affection. I deserve a lot of pain in my life but I don't feel as though I deserve to be told I'm worth something to you and then have to slowly watch you throw me away.

I wonder what you might think if you saw my body in it's current state. Would you feel regret? Perhaps disgusted? Or would you feel anything at all? Did you ever feel anything?
