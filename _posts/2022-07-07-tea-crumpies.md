Before I *actually* say much - here is the song for the post. You're obligated to listen to it at least once.

First of all - I have more shout-outs. I got a random notification on my phone last night, and behold:

![kate bought coffee](/img/22-7-7-tea/kate_screen.png)

Honestly Kate - you really didn't have to, but I'm so very thankful that you did. You're the best. <3 I'm happy to have people like you in my life. Speaking of people like you in my life....**Val!**
You read my blog yesterday as well. I know, because you mentioned my playlist had a buncha *bangers*. I'm happy that my friends are looking through some of the sdinky stuff I'm putting out here.

I really appreciate you all. Each of you have impacted and changed my life for the better. (Even you Byonk, although I know you're not likely to read this.)

## Here lately...
I've thought about my place in this cog of life, and what I'm supposed to do. I was asked one time:
> If your plans on being a developer ever fell through, you would want a backup plan. You might want to start thinking about that.

The man was wise in his own right I suppose. He also had a dream at one point, a dream he was never able to achieve. So he fell back on something else. 

For me - if I were to have a *"fall back plan"* it might be writing. But this is more of a pleasure of mine that it is something I would like to do as a career. I've written since I was very young, I remember writing my first short novel when I was 13. I constantly read various fiction books and just let my imagination run wild. 

However having a fall back isn't an option. Working in the computer tech field is one of the few things I'm sure of, at least in terms of me wanting to *do* it. I've had many aspirations prior to this of course, my journey to this point has been rather odd.

**I remember** being 16 and sitting in a Army recruiter's office. At that time in my life, I'd admired the 101st Airborne battalion, the 75th Ranger regiment, and various other facets of the Army. I wanted to be a part of that culture, and that's where I thought I would end up. However when I turned 18 **I had somehow ended up in a private Christian University...** my purpose there was pastoral studies. They were a bit of a weird school, even by Christian standards. The Chapel speakers fluctuated twice weekly, and the odd thing was that it seemed like they didn't vet who spoke - on Monday one person may say something that the speaker on Wednesday may completely contradict; and when you finally show up for your religious studies class on Thursday - he contradicts both speakers! ***Alas, that is Christianity in a nutshell.*** (Also their football team was named the Crusaders... so they weren't afraid of that 'fun' piece of history)

I left after my first year 1/2, having made few friends (and been used for my music technician skills by one of the music pastors. Another facet of Christianity!)
I decided the best way to help people was to become an EMT/Paramedic; and so that's exactly what I did. The following spring I passed my NREMT practical and "written", and received my patches + state certifications, then went to work.


I'd mentioned the weird EMS situation and the eventual downfall in <a href="https://charlotte-2222.github.io/2022/06/26/being-me.html">this</a> post, so I won't go back over that. After finding CompSci - and doing really well my first semester in C++, I stuck with programming and database as my degree.

**In short - I've worked my ass off to get here, and this is where I want to be.**
This is the fallback plan of *all* fallback plans, yet it's genuinely something I enjoy. (At least for now.) So I'll be damned if someone tries to take that from me, or tell me that It won't work out for me. **I'm gonna get that job, and you can cry about it.**

## DeSantis. Dear God.

This man is MAGA 2.0 and quite honestly showing signs of fascist leadership. 

This just simply a ridiculous concept. DeSantis is building a sparkling Conservative platform with his legislation that has done nasty things such as:
- Banned the word *gay* (what if I'm just really happy?)
- Banned the concept that *slavery is bad* from being taught in schools
- Overturned the COVID Safety in Hospitals, because *"...Never again will Florida families be denied the right to visit a loved one in the hospital"* (Dumbass Gina Carano loves this shit)
- Removed any right to privacy for students in schools regarding their mental or physical well being. (Sorry, if you're 16-17 and questioning your sexuality but don't wanna tell your homophobic dad? Too bad! Your teacher/Counselor *has* too!)


This guy is mini-trump, but the unfortunate thing is he actually has a brain and can't quite be manipulated by foreign nations. (Not that Russia is in the position to do that anymore)

## On a lighter note, it's 7/7/7

Which means it's **Bungie Day**

![mister chief](/img/22-7-7-tea/MisterChief1.webp)

I have been playing Bungie's games since 2006, having started with Halo 2. I didn't have my own Xbox and didn't have Halo 2 on Windows (Vista?) at the time; So I had to walk next door to my neighbors house and play Halo with her. Summer of '06, I was there every day playing Halo. 

Eventually I got my Dad Halo: CE, but really I purchased it for myself. After beating the campaign, I played *The Silent Cartographer* over and over - the intro sequence was one of my favorites in the series; that is until I got Xbox 360 and Halo 3 for Christmas in 2007.

Bungie blew me away with the music, the campaign, the aesthetics. It was the best thing my young eyes had ever seen at that time. *The Ark* has quite possibly the best intro sequence in the entire game, and the score that accompanied... *chef's kiss*

I of course played everything else Bungie put out. The remaining Halos, I cried at the ending screen of Halo: Reach, thinking this might be their last game - but then jumped in excitement at Destiny.

**Destiny has given me a lot of precious memories**. It has helped keep my relationship afloat, flower new ones, it's helped me discover parts of myself that I tucked deep, and I've gotten to meet a substantial amount of precious people; some are lost to me now, and I miss them very much - but our memories are *Not Forgotten*.

Bungie has really done something special, and I'm happy to participate in something they've created.

<hr>


Also, shout out to Jesus for *surrendering*. I promise you'll have fun.

To everyone reading this - I love you, you're awesome and special, never forget how much ass you can kick:

![go kick 1000 asses](/img/22-7-7-tea/kick_ass.png)

1,000 pounds is probably a lot. So:

- Go kick your day with 1,000 lbs of force right in it's ass
- Kick 1,000 days with 1lbs of force right in it's ass

Either way, have fun. :)
