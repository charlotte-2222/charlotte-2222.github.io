Hey hi how are ya. I feel like shit, thanks for asking! But really, I woke up with a huge migraine that hasn't quite worn off yet and my entire head feels foggy. It's really impeding my ability to think - a moment ago I had to dunk my face into water, which *sorta* helped. 

This is gonna be a stupid simple post. I may post later today but I'm doing a little bit of blog maintenance. The gist of it is that I have a large amount of posts entitled *"Life"* (see below)

## I want to fix this

A lot of these are ranty by nature, so if that's the case -> *Tagged as "Rant"*
I'm hoping to divide things up a bit, so the Archives aren't quite as jumbled.

That said my main issue is that the main page still displays *all* of the posts. Everything I've done to try to fix that has not - well fixed it.

I'll come back to that after tag maintenance I suppose.

# Anywho

I feel like shit, hopefully doing this will make me feel better - then I can make a proper post.
**Here's our song to get us started:**
