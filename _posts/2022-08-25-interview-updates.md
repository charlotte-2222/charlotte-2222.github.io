I've been pretty silent about things lately - my posts have mostly been superficial and short when they were posted, so here I am breaking said silence; with a little bit of philosophy.

I've had a long past two weeks - it was quite draining actually. Everything from arguments, a past long dead having inexplicably returned to the forefront of thought, many interviews; and finally - a doctors appointment to end my Thursday.


# Silentium est aureum.
*"Silence is golden."*

To be human is to communicate and express. Humanity expresses emotion and desire, each of us have a point of view in which we see a situation, how we relate to the world; or ourselves. (i.e., personal view).

A worldview is that which the whole of society and your role in relation to said society, and what your standing is regarding this worldview verses another. We use a world view as foundation to see and understand the world around us, especially regarding politics, philosophy, and religion.

### Often times,
as humans we espouse a worldview. In fact, every human likely has a worldview whether they know it or not. Neutrality in ideology is indeed a personal view taken from one's worldview.

The way one chooses to speak on behalf or even defend their worldview can get the person in question in some serious trouble. Not necessarily *legal* trouble, although that can be the case depending on the government. 

### However -
On the scale of the social group, wherein two or more people interact regularly - *'trouble'* can brew more easily.

Social groups can exists in many ways, sociologists have spent the past 50 years or so studying these unique phenomena from the scientific point of view with special interest; obtaining all sorts of data for categorization.

Simply put: **A social group is a collection of people who interact with one another based on shared characteristics and a sense of unity.**

> To some extent every social group creates boundaries between itself and other groups, but a cohesive in‐group typically has three characteristics: 
> 
> - Members use titles, external symbols, and dress to distinguish themselves from the out‐group.
> - Members tend to clash or compete with members of the out‐group. This competition with the other group can also strengthen the unity within each group.
> - Members apply positive stereotypes to their in‐group and negative stereotypes to the out‐group.

## So where are you going with all of this, Char?

I tend to keep my mouth shut *(Silentium est aureum.)* about a lot of things in social groups. Either because I like to watch things crash and burn, or because I don't care to disrupt the group structure. While I may be perfectly in my right to do or say something, I simply choose not to.

Is this a problematic reflection upon my character? Possibly. 

In groups such as these, while the people apart of it may have initially clicked due to shared characteristics, eventually another characteristic will come to light that enforces negativity; whether it's mine or another's. This leads to the others forming opinions and judgment, and eventually the group divides (even if it's not a complete half).

### For me, I tend to keep quiet as I watch these characteristics emerge.
I'm never sure if other people feel the same way that I do, perhaps I may find one person to confide in. But I prefer not to *'Jump the Gun'*, so to speak.

Although when all people in the social sphere are concerned, its worthwhile to consider the feelings and harmony of the group. 

The situation eventually comes to a head in one way or another, good or bad.

# Interviews

I wont mention the where or the who, as I'm sure the company wouldn't appreciate it all that much. I'm not sure if they monitor my socials/blog or not, however I would rather not upset them and ruin any chances that I may have.

This past week was quite busy, as I was invited to interview with both directors of a department that I'm very interested in working for. The work they do is very meaningful in regards to the average person - they don't provide a software service or some social media related software. What they do is almost entirely clinical and to improve the daily life of regular people.

I was of course very nervous and I'm not sure how well I did on the technical portion of the interview. In interviews I tend to forget basic things - they just go right out the window. But that's to be expected I suppose. 

What impresses me the most is how long the interviewers have worked at their department, both are at ~20 years on the job. They love what they do, the people they work with, and the environment. 

Seemingly, this is everything I want. I know I'm green, and I know they have high expectations; but I want it - and I can do it. I hope it happens.

# Doc's Appt

I had another appointment/bloodwork today. God, that took forever.
My hormone therapy has been going great so far. My dosages are increasing pretty frequently, and now my doctor has added progesterone as well as having again increased the estradiol. I'm already on my maxed spiro, so I'm all good there.

I never thought I'd be here a year ago, but here I am. Taking life as it comes with some *solid* makeup skills (even my doctor complimented me on it, mentioning that she wished she could do the same)

I'm significantly happier than I was before. I'm starting to feel whole.

## *Per aspera ad astra*
Things have been really hard for me these past few years, and I feel incredibly lucky to get to where I am today; but I do need more out of life - so I'm going to keep crawling and grabbing until I get what I want. 


### Song the day
I know, I did it reverse this time.

I do want to do a quick shoutout to few people. There's a lot of other special people of course, but these few deserve a special mention. They've been good people, and I don't see that changing.
