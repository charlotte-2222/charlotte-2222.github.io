Beep boop, heres a song

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/7g58hxINhGGQafBUxUUwT1?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

also I have registered new domain names for this blog and a few of my other sites.

Here they are:


- <a href="https://www.charlottes-web.gay/">https://www.charlottes-web.gay/</a> -> Directs to the blog
- <a href="https://www.charlottes-web.gay/charr-lang/">https://www.charlottes-web.gay/charr-lang/</a> -> Directs to charr-lang doc page
- <a href="https://www.charlottes-web.gay/links/">https://www.charlottes-web.gay/links/</a> -> Directs to my general links page
- <a href="https://www.charlottes-web.gay/char-site/">https://www.charlottes-web.gay/char-site/</a> -> Directs to my portfolio.
  
  Pretty cool stuff. I *could* combine it all within my blog, however I don't quite feel like doing so. This works out.



### Thats all!
