I am awake early due partially to my excitement for today and in part due to neck pains from sleeping positions. So I figured - lets write a bit. I've got good shit going on, lets dissect.

### First - music.

Some good old Bilmuri this time around.

# So the happenings -

I've been back on ye'olde dating app for a week ~ish now and suddenly have met two incredibly nice dudes and now have two dates lined up this weekend. Honestly speaking, given my dating life in the past - the fact that this is even happening in the first place feels... crazy to me?

Both guys are interesting in various ways and I'm really excited to see where it goes with them, hopefully good places. I've got really high hopes for at least one of them :D

### The fun thing in all of this,
...both guys are huge nerds in a lot of ways. They've worked with various programming languages, or at the very least are tech-savy. We share a lot of the same interests, but differ in other ways - probably the good ways.

*Probably the not so fun part* in all of this is me asking what these guys do job wise at some point during our conversation, receiving an answer (either direct or vague), and then getting the question back...

"Hahaha... *nah*... I'm not doing 'nothin :)"

#### That all said -

I've got a date today, and another tomorrow. I'm stoked. I can't wait to meet them.

# State of the HRT

In a few weeks, on March 8th, I will have officially been on HRT for a year. This past Wednesday I had my first yearly review to get blood work, levels, see how things are going.

### Before anything else -
I've gotta talk about my experiences here first. I know that some people who go to Planned Parenthoods for gender affirming care have a poor time, it can be dysphoric, and an all around worse experience than if they were to go elsewhere.

*However* - I've not had that experience. The workers have all handled my documents carefully, and over the course of a year I've been deadnamed exactly twice in the following circumstances:

1. I was having an issue with payment, I didn't have money to pay for my medications (or the appt.) at the time. Typically I go for an appt. every 3mos, and thus get my medication refill then (as up until now, they've been increasing dosage/strengths each time.)  When I called to ask for an abridged prescription until my next appt., the receiving specialist deadnamed me as he did not immediately see my preferred name in the documentation. Once he did, however, he immediately apologized and corrected himself. He was probably the nicest old guy I've ever heard from, at least over the phone.
2. An appointment I had in ~November/December, a new nurse was given my old intake form that did not have my preferred name on it - and of course shouted for my deadname to a room full of people :') She immediately apologized afterwards when she realized what happened.

All-in-all, this particular location is incredibly good about catching things, as well as apologizing when they make mistakes. Moreover, their staff is friendly and understanding - I've made swift friends one of the nurses, Subrina who is possibly the *sweetest* woman I've met and gives the most pain-free blood draws I've ever experienced in my life.

**Regarding other staff,** the NP I see is amazing. The constant compliments I receive about my makeup just makes me feel so happy inside, especially on Wednesday when I decided I'd only put on a little bit. Other times she's incredibly down to earth. The past year has been insane regarding trans-politics across the US, and I asked her a question regarding such a policy and how it might have an effect on me personally. At first she had been hesitant, and answered vaguely - due to a some policy, but eventually she pulled her mask down and got really quiet:

> It's bullshit, what these people are doing. They have no reason except hatred. They full well know that the end consequence is that people will die and they simply don't give a shit. It fills me with so much anger.

And that's when I found out she was based as fuck, and does activist work outside of medical work. I love these people, sincerely. 

## That all said...

I'm now at a point where I can move onto 6month appointments only, which makes me sad as I will see these wonderful people less. I had the option to move to injections, and almost took it - however I'd like to see how I progress on pills for the next few months and go from there before I begin injections.

**But I damn well know I'll be on injections soon, I won't be able to resist.** I gotta get my stabby-stabby girl juice.

These people have handled my care so wonderfully and I'm so happy I finally took this path.

I'm seeing so much in this small trailer that I'm so incredibly excited for. Deathstar Traveler being one of them. Most of all, I'm just excited I get to experience the campaign with two of my wonderful partners - Jes√∫s & Katherine. I'm excited. I've gotten pretty excited for a few trailers before, but this one is pretty hype.

Oki doki thats all I've got, I just wanted to write for a bit today.
