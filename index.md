Welcome! I'm Charlotte - just an irregular girl on an irregular planet doing irregular things with an incredibily irregular Chihuahua and partner.

I was told by someone pretty smart that every developer should have a blog - and I write *a lot*

...so here I am. Good luck, you'll need it!
(p.s., check out my <a href="https://charlotte-2222.github.io/char-site/">portfolio</a> if you havent already)
