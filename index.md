I'm just a girl with a blog, I code, I make things, I do stuff, and I'm a cult leader (not really. Or really...? Ask me about my Cult). 

### CW:
All blog posts reflect my personal held opinions and do not reflect that of my employer(s), organizations, etc.

This blog serves as an "online-journal" of sorts, as such my posts are a "flow of thoughts"; This blog does not pretend to be a resume padder, few posts are filtered. I write on my personal life, politics, video games, and various other things that fit my need at the moment. I do attempt to grammar check on occassion.

If you feel you need to look at any of my actual work, do so via my <a href="https://www.charlottes-web.gay/char-site/">portfolio.</a>
