This is my journal, but it's online. I think that's called a blog - maybe.

### Content Warning:

My posts are a "flow of thoughts", This blog does not pretend to be a resume padder, few posts are filtered. I write on my personal life, politics, video games, and various other things that fit my need at the moment. I do attempt to grammar check on occasion.
