Welcome! I'm Charlotte - I'm incredibly opinionated on a variety of things and like to talk about that - I also have a girl-boss complex and will attempt to gaslight you into giving me a job.

I was told by someone pretty smart that every developer should have a blog - but after having this blog for a while I've realized I don't talk about code often - **but i do bitch about republicans.**

**Here is my Spotify playlist!**

...so here I am. Good luck, you'll need it!
